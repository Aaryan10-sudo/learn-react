Frontend 
html => structure
css => is used to beautify
react => is used to deals with data

Image = always place image in public folder . in src of image tag always points the public folder

Component:
    Component are function whose first letter is always capital and it is called just like calling
    tag. <Home></Home>

    Component must return only one wrapper.
    <> </> => it is called react fragment 

    Use {} (curly braces) to perform javascript operation inside tag (+,-,8,/,variable call, map, filter)

    Component are custom tag

Anything that is written inside return of component are printed(displayed) on the browser.


Routing :(Changing Path)

        NavLink changes the URL 
        Route gives component based on URL

        localhost:3000/blog?name=Ram&age=20 => URL
        |__________________||______________|
        Anything before ? is Route
        Anything after ? is called query string or search string

        Here, blog is called route parameter and name , age is called query parameter
